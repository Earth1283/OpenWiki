Historical Patterns

.. list-table:: The Lifecycle of a Summer Host
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Phase
     - Description
   * - **June**
     - Launch with a $5 WHMCS license and a stolen website template. Heavy advertising on Discord.
   * - **July**
     - Massive sales. "Founder" buys a new gaming PC with the revenue instead of paying the server bills.
   * - **August**
     - Upstream provider cuts them off for non-payment. Discord server is deleted. "Founder" goes back to school.
   * - **Result**
     - Total loss of world files, player data, and pre-paid balances.
