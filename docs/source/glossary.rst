   JVM
      Java Virtual Machine. The engine that runs Minecraft server software.

   Garbage Collector (GC)
      A form of automatic memory management. The GC attempts to reclaim memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use by the program.

   Heap
      The area of memory used by the JVM for dynamic memory allocation. This is what you control with the ``-Xmx`` and ``-Xms`` flags.

   Fork
      In the context of server software, a "fork" is a version of the software that is based on another, usually adding new features or performance optimizations (e.g., Paper is a fork of Spigot).

   Ticking
      The process by which the server calculates game logic (movement, growth, AI). A healthy server runs at 20 ticks per second (TPS).

   Griefing
      The act of intentionally irritating and angering people in video games through various activities such as destroying other players' creations.

   PaperMC
      A high-performance fork of the Spigot web server, aimed at fixing gameplay and mechanics inconsistencies as well as improving performance.

   Purpur
      A drop-in replacement for Paper servers designed for ease-of-use and configuration flexibility.

   Proxy
      A server that acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from other servers. In Minecraft, proxies like Velocity link multiple game servers together.

   Backdoor
      A hidden method of bypassing normal authentication or security controls in a plugin or system, often used for malicious purposes.

   VPS
      Virtual Private Server. A virtual machine sold as a service by an Internet hosting provider. It runs its own copy of an operating system.

   SSH Key
      An access credential for the Secure Shell (SSH) network protocol. It is more secure than a password because it is nearly impossible to "brute-force."

   DDoS
      Distributed Denial of Service. A cyber-attack in which the perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services of a host connected to the Internet.
